# Item_demand_forcasting

# Problem Statement
Demand forecasts are fundamental to planning and delivering products and services. Accurate forecasting of demand can help the manufacturers to maintain appropriate stock which results in a reduction in loss due to product not being sold and also reduces the opportunity cost (i.e. higher demand but less availability => opportunity lost). Despite such relevance, manufacturers have difficulty choosing which forecast model is the best for their use case. In this project, historical sales data corresponding to multiple(25) items sold in 10 stores are provided and participants are expected to come up with the best model to predict the future demand for products which results in maximum profit for the manufacturer. Predict the demand for the next 3 months at the item level (i.e. all the stores combined).
